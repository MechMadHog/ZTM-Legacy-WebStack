## React Concepts

### The birth of React.js (2013)

Before modern front-end frameworks, the browser stack was simple:

* **HTML** → page structure
* **CSS** → presentation and layout
* **JavaScript** → interactivity

Early web applications revolved around forms. Users submitted data to a server, the server processed it, and a new page was returned. This request-response model defined how most sites behaved.

A major challenge was browser inconsistency. Different browsers interpreted JavaScript differently, forcing developers to write compatibility workarounds.

### The rise of libraries and structure

To address cross-browser issues, **jQuery** provided a consistent way to interact with the DOM (Document Object Model). It simplified event handling, animations, and element manipulation, allowing developers to focus more on behavior than compatibility fixes.

As applications grew, JavaScript codebases became harder to manage. Frameworks such as **Backbone.js** introduced structure and organization, helping developers separate concerns and manage increasing complexity.

This evolution contributed to the rise of **single page applications (SPAs)**, powered by AJAX. Instead of reloading entire pages, applications dynamically updated content, creating smoother user experiences.

### Framework standardization

In 2010, Google released **AngularJS**, which quickly became a major front-end framework. It promoted structured architecture using an MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, organizing code by responsibility and encouraging large-scale application design.

### Why React emerged

As front-end systems continued to grow in complexity, Facebook engineers faced recurring architectural challenges across large teams. React.js was created to improve consistency, maintainability, and predictable UI behavior.

Its design emphasized component architecture and clear data flow, allowing teams to scale applications without losing structural clarity.

React represented a shift from page-driven development toward composable UI systems built for modern, interactive applications.
