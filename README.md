# ZTM Course Lab — React + Web Developer Track

This repository documents my structured progression through Zero To Mastery’s **Complete React Developer** and **Complete Web Developer** courses.

The goal is not just to follow tutorials, but to treat each section as a hands-on lab — reinforcing concepts, experimenting, refactoring, and building production-ready understanding.

This repo functions as:

- A learning journal
- A sandbox for experiments
- A reference vault
- A portfolio artifact

Everything here reflects deliberate practice, iteration, and incremental improvement.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

This repository is designed to:

- Reinforce real-world development workflow
- Build fluency with React and MERN stack patterns
- Develop debugging and refactoring habits
- Practice writing maintainable code
- Understand architecture decisions — not just syntax
- Bridge tutorial knowledge into portfolio-level skills

---

## 🧪 Learning Method

Each section follows a deliberate cycle:

1. Learn core concept
2. Implement tutorial baseline
3. Modify or extend functionality
4. Document observations
5. Refactor for clarity

Where possible, projects are adapted beyond tutorial defaults to encourage problem solving.

## 🔍 Philosophy

This repository is about **understanding systems**, not copying tutorials.

Every concept is explored with the intent to:

- Break it
- Fix it
- Improve it
- Rebuild it

The goal is durable knowledge, not short-term completion.

---

## 🚧 Ongoing Work

This repo grows continuously as coursework progresses. Expect:

- Refactors
- Architecture changes
- Expanded documentation
- Additional experiments

Learning is iterative by design.

---

## 📌 Notes

- Some code reflects learning stages
- Later commits may refactor earlier sections
- Comments are intentionally verbose in early modules

---

## ✅ Outcome Goal

By completion, this repository should demonstrate:

- Practical React fluency
- Full-stack MERN competency
- Production-level workflow habits
- Independent problem solving ability
